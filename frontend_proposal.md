#FrontEnd Project Proposal
####Jon Tejada 2015-11-09

My project will be a partial rebuild of the [sedonaSV.com](http://sedonaSV.com) website. 

[sedonaSV.com](http://sedonaSV.com) is the website for my family's buisiness in Arizona. I've build a number of generations of the site. This project will involve adding two features to the current working site.

The first feature is a smart image gallery that uses [isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to add filters that the user can interact with. 

The second feature is a square footage calculator that allows potential customers to calculate the stone they will need for their project. A user will input measurements into a well designed form. The output will include calculated values and the option to print/email the relevant info.
