#FrontEnd Project Proposal
####Jon Tejada 2015-11-09

My project will be one of the following: a mapping game/visualization that interacts with the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) or a partial rebuild of the [sedonaSV.com](http://sedonaSV.com) website. 

##map
The mapping project will be given a particular location from the user (e.g. Galvanize SOMA, a home address, etc.) and output onto the page a map and list of nearby places of interest that are calculated with the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/). This will include such things as closest convenience store, closest grocery store, nearby public transportation routes, and so on. 

It will take a number of user inputs including form fields and mouse/keyboard inputs for interaction with the map window. 

Additional results/visualization  can pull from the [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).


##rebuild
[sedonaSV.com](http://sedonaSV.com) is the website for my family's buisiness in Arizona. I've build a number of generations of the site. This project will involve adding two features to the current working site.

The first feature is a smart image gallery that uses [isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to add filters that the user can interact with. 

The second feature is a square footage calculator that allows potential customers to calculate the stone they will need for their project. A user will input measurements into a well designed form. The output will include calculated values and the option to print/email the relevant info.
